1. ## General Provisions

    1. The server is provided "as is". The administration does not guarantee uninterrupted operation or data integrity.
    2. The administration reserves the right to block access to any player without prior notice or explanation.
    3. Any changes, failures, or complete loss of progress may occur. The server does not compensate or restore lost resources.
    4. The administration independently determines punishments, using the rules as guidelines only.
    5. Server rules may be changed by the administration at any time without prior notice.
        1. New versions of the rules are announced in the server's official Telegram chat.
        2. Disagreement with the new rules implies an immediate cessation of play on the server.
    6. Players are required to know and follow the rules; ignorance of the rules does not exempt from responsibility.
    7. By joining the server, the player automatically agrees to all rules and administrative decisions.
    8. The player is solely responsible for the security and actions performed from their account.
    9. Bans are applied by IP address. In the case of shared IPs, all users of that IP share responsibility.
